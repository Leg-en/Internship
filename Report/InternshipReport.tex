\subsection{Motivation}
As a Master’s student specializing in Geoinformatics and Spatial Data Science, my internship at con terra represents a strategic step in my professional development. Given my previous work experience with the company, I am already familiar with its standing as a leading geospatial software provider in Münster. This familiarity allows me to integrate seamlessly into the team and contribute effectively from the onset. The focus of the internship on software development is in perfect harmony with my academic training, promising a direct application of theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. My objective during this internship is to further refine my software development skills, leveraging the opportunities at con terra to enhance my technical expertise in geospatial IT

\section{Internship Content}
The projects i worked on in my internship differ from the ones specified in the Learning Agreement. The only project from the learning agreement that i acutally participated in were the GD NRW DAM Project. The other projects were deemed infeasible. Therefore i participated in the \glsxtrshort {dz} project and in the Geosphere project. 
%My internship was clearly structured. This took the form three different Projects, each in their own timeframe and with their own requirements.

\subsection{Geologischer Dienst NRW - Metdata Asset Managment System}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
The  \glsxtrshort {gd} NRW  is the central geoscientific institution of NRW and has a large achieve of different assets, which are currently managed by a software named cumulus. As the used software is outdated, it does not meet the the current requirements.
Primarily they  are required to make all data, where it is legally possible, open data \cite{GesetzZurForderung2017}.
Additionally the GeolDG also requires the \glsxtrshort{gd} to make their accessible by the public \cite{GesetzZurStaatlichen2020}.

Therefore, the main goal of this project was to conceptualize a new system and to implement parallel a prototype of it.
\subsubsection{As-is Status}
The \glsxtrshort{gd} digital archive contains over 450,000 assets. Assets in this context are for example images, PDFs, TIFs or MP4s. However, any digital file can be an asset. The total data volume is over 2 terabytes.
These assets are currently located on a shared drive and can be managed via the file system. They also use a piece of software called Cumulus. This software primarily manages the metadata associated with the assets. Currently, the \glsxtrshort{gd} does not use any known metadata schema, but instead uses a list of custom attributes, such as Rating, Special Instructions and Label.
They also use \glsxtrshort{exif} and \glsxtrshort{iptc} metadata information for images, which is not managed by Cumulus. Instead, this is done with an additional software component. %Likely Irfanview 

% \subsubsection{The new system}
% The new system exists maninly as a concept. But a few features were already implemented as a prototype for the \glsxtrshort{gd} to test them.
\subsubsection{Requirements}
The new system should eliminate the inadequacies of the old system. Therefore a list of Requirements were collected. In the following there is a subset example of the main functional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keeping the Internal metadata attributes (and adding new ones)
    \item Connection to the GEOportal.NRW
    \item CRUD Operations for Datasets and associated metadata
          \begin{itemize}
              \item With an Integrated Permission System for Internal (\glsxtrshort{gd} Employees) and Externals
              \item (Multi-)Edit Interface for Metadata
          \end{itemize}
    \item Sharing data
    \item Update \glsxtrshort{exif} and \glsxtrshort{iptc} when an update occurs
    \item Syncing/Translating Internal Metadata to ISO 19115/ISO 19119
    \item Different Search Operations
\end{itemize}




In addition, there are a number of quality requirements that focus primarily on data integrity and the tech stack used for development. For example, the software developed should be able to live in the cloud or on a dedicated machine.

A final requirement is that the system needs to be split. It should mainly run on the servers of  GD NRW. But  non-sensitive data should be hosted also publicly by IT.NRW. 

\subsubsection{Technical Aspects}
To meet these Requirements the smart.finder SDI was choosen as base software. As it can not meet all requirements standalone (for example it can only work with ISO 19115/ISO 19119, INPSIRE or GDI DE Metadata) new software components were conceptualized and implemented to meet the designated requirements.



As seen in \ref{fig:components} and \ref{fig:deployment} the new Software consists of a gd-nrw-api, gd-nrw-dam-smartfinder-sdi, gd-nrw-dam and gd-nrw-datastore.
In the following each software component will be shortly described:
\begin{description}[]
    \item[gd-nrw-dam-smartfinder-sdi]: This represents the smart.finder SDI, comprising several software components, including the smartfinder-search, smartfinder-editor, smartfinder-csw and smartfinder-sdi, as well as the gd-nrw-dam-portal.
          \begin{description}[]
              \item[smartfinder-search]: This component is responsible for managing data. It operates on an integrated Apache Solr instance to enable the search and filter capabilites of the smartfinder. It also enables features such as full-text search, geo-searches, and filtering for specific attribute values.
              \item[smartfinder-editor]: This component represents the smart.editor, which enables the editing of Metadata in compliance with ISO 19115/ISO 19119, INSPIRE, or GDI DE.
              \item[smartfinder-csw]: This component serves as the \glsxtrshort{csw} interface, enabling the dissemination of data to other portals, including the GEOportal.NRW.
              \item[smartfinder-sdi]: This component constitutes the user interface for searching and accessing datasets.
              \item[gd-nrw-dam-portal]: This component is an adapted version of the smartfinder-sdi component.
          \end{description}
    \item[gd-nrw-dam]: This component offers \glsxtrshort{crud} functionality for metadata, including a frontend for Multi-Edit Metadata and Editing Single Metadata.
    \item[gd-nrw-datastore]: This component is responsible for the raw data access. It has the ability to function with both the raw file system and S3 Storages. It offers fundamental CRUD capabilities for the data.
    \item[gd-nrw-api]: This component stores the metadata and manages the communication between the newly developed software components and the smartfinder-sdi.
\end{description}
%The general workflow for documents is that all editing is done by \glsxtrshort{gd} Staff, therefore their component handle all editing.

As the GD wanted to keept its own Metadata scheme, an additional database was required to save these Attributes.  This database  is called gd-nrw-metadata. %Its schema special developed to not allow any M-N relationships, as this was required.  The schema is visible in \ref{fig:db}.



 To achieve the goal of splitting the data between two hosts, there are now two datastores that can be switched in place. This is necessary to allow authorised users to access sensitive data. The public datastore from IT.NRW gets only the non-sensitive data.

\subsubsection{My Participation}
My involvement in this project focused on the development of new software components for a prototype. Furthermore, I made modifications to the smartfinder-sdi.



The initial prototype commenced as a basic project employing FastAPI and Python. It also integrated an added PostgreSQL database. The first objective was to construct a database schema tailored to our requirements. The final configuration for the prototype is depicted in Graphic \ref{fig:db}. We opted for a flat structure with no N-M relationships.
Also, I designed the frontend. Our technological stack for the frontend consisted of Vue and Vuetify, with the inclusion of a Vite development server. The primary Vue components that I developed include Single Editing for modifying a single Metadataset and Multi-Edit for modifying multiple Metadatasets. To create Single Editing, I used a mockup as a template to base my development on. I designed and conceptualised Multi-Editing myself, as demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:multiedit}.

Later on in the project, I developed an additional front-end for a shopping cart, which serves as an intermediary website between the Smartfinder and the new components. Moreover, I developed a front-end for the administrator to configure various attributes for editing.




Subsequently, the decision was made to switch from Python and FastAPI to Spring Boot and Java. As a result, I started working on the gd-nrw-dam module, which includes the gd-nrw-datastore module as a prototype. First, I implemented the necessary Spring Data classes and interfaces, and then proceeded to create the basic endpoints for CRUD operations to restore functionality to my frontend. In addition, the project includes the ability to host the front-end on the Spring Boot server. A Spring Boot controller was developed specifically to maintain the functionality of the Vue router component, which controls page routing. The code for this can be found in 
\ref{fig:vue}. It is important to note that any requests that match the applied regex pattern will be directed to the Vue Router.

Following that, I developed an Azure build pipeline for automated deployment on our test system.  To achieve this, I restructured the project into two separate components: the frontend and the backend, each with its own pom.xml file. Additionally, there is a pom file for the entire project, enabling Maven to build the project with the complete frontend included in the backend for the pipeline. The tomcat-maven-plugin was then used for deployment to our test machine.

Later, I developed the Sfsdi API component, which serves as a predecessor to the gd-nrw API. It is a Spring Boot application that accesses the Smartfinder-Search module and alters its Solr database. During development, I extended the smartfinder-search Solr core to handle additional data types beyond ISO. Moreover, I enhanced the frontend of the smartfinder-sdi, effectively creating the gd-nrw-dam-portal component.
Also i created an automated ISO XML generation.

I have also developed several complex features, including thumbnail generation for images and PDFs, on-the-fly zipped group downloads, \glsxtrshort{iptc}/\glsxtrshort{exif} read and write capabilities, and the deployment of a Redis Instance for fast and secure storage. These addition will facilitate the transition from the smartfinder to the new components. Also i deployed an Nginx instance as a reverse proxy for basic authentication, with TLS support.

Finally, I participated multiple estimation workshops to estimate the complexity for the complete project realization.

\subsubsection{Project Reflection}
The project was a small-scale project with about 4 people working on it, myself being the only person working on the implementation on the prototype. I had one team member who provided support, but their role was more that of a software architect than a developer. 
We held meetings twice a week to discuss the project's progress. In addition to development, we heavily utilised a Jira board with tickets to track progress. I was not involved in the project's conception.
The estimation workshops took place a few months after my participation in the project, during which I was included in the estimation process.


\subsection{\glsxtrfull{dz}}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
In the wake of the catastrophic flooding in Ahrtal, significant deficiencies in the hazard prevention and emergency response systems of (NRW) were exposed. Critical challenges were observed in the coordination and communication among dispatched units, such as the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (\glsxtrshort{thw}) and the fire department. Effective communication and organization are crucial for swift and efficient emergency responses.

Following the enactment of the "Krisenbewältigungsgesetz" in NRW in December 2022, the state government officially recognized this deficiency as an emergency situation on February 23. In response, a budget of €500,000 was allocated to address this issue.

con terra, in collaboration with IT.NRW, submitted a proposal to develop a solution to these challenges. Their proposed solution is the creation of a digital twin, designed to aggregate and optimally visualize all relevant data for various potential scenarios. This solution aims to integrate multiple datasets from diverse sources, including the GDI-NW, LVN, and the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG).

For me, this project was split into two phases. As I was assigned to another project while working on the digital twin.

\subsubsection{As-is Status}
There are currently no central systems in place to handle this kind of task. Mostly there are department specific solutions or even general purpose Systems like QGIS or ArcGIS.


\subsubsection{Requirements}
This project, primarily a consultancy initiative aimed at developing a prototype, has a set of flexible yet pivotal requirements. Some requirements were also refined and established in collaboration with fire departments during the project's course. Below is a summary of the key requirements:

\begin{description}[]
    \item[Three-Dimensional Capability]: Reflecting the three-dimensional nature of real-world challenges, the solution must be capable of visualizing 3D data and performing basic general-purpose operations, such as measurements, in a 3D environment.
    \item[Scenario-Optimized Geodata]: The digital twin should tailor its data visualization and accessibility for different emergency scenarios, acknowledging that not all datasets are suitable for every scenario. Primary scenario groups include Fire, Earth, Water, and Air.
    \item[Compliance with \glsxtrshort{bhkg}]: The prototype should be developed with the objective of planning, monitoring, and follow-up in accordance with \glsxtrshort{bhkg} standards.
    \item[Target Group - Authorities and Security Organizations]: The prototype should be user-friendly for its target audience, which includes authorities and organizations involved in security tasks, without assuming extensive geospatial knowledge.
    \item[Cloud-Based Solution]: The entire application should be cloud-based, ensuring accessibility and scalability.
    \item[Fine-Grained Access Control]: Given the potential inclusion of sensitive data (e.g., \glsxtrshort{kritis} data), the application must feature a robust access control system, allowing users to view only data relevant to their roles and responsibilities.
    \item[Analysis Tools]: The application should offer comprehensive analysis tools. For the prototype, these will include the ability to identify and assess the accessibility of protected assets, dynamically determine water levels in 3D, and simulate the spread of smoke clouds in 3D.
    \item[Integration of 3D Meshes]: The prototype should incorporate a detailed 3D mesh, which is currently being developed for the entire state of NRW.
    \item[EPSG: 25832 Standard]: As a governmental project, the application must utilize the EPSG: 25832 standard for all geospatial data.
\end{description}

However, it is important to note that not all these requirements will be fully met in the initial phase of this project.


\subsubsection{Technical Aspects}
The project used as a base map.apps and was in an agile manner developed. From the requirements just a few were implemented.

\subsubsection{My Participation}
I joined the project in its final stages, focusing on a limited but significant set of tasks. My primary responsibility involved integrating data provided by the fire department. I worked with a PEI Dataset, which consisted of radio messages containing location data, such as Short PDU, Long PDU, or STATUS. An example of this data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pei}. The first line of each message includes metadata, like the transmitting and receiving parties, and the message type. The HEX-Code following this metadata can be converted to binary and decoded according to the ETSI TS 100 392-18-1 standard. I developed a Python script to automate this process, outputting the data as an ESRI feature layer.

Additionally, I developed a new map control tool, enhancing user interaction with map features such as position, rotation, tilt, and zoom. This tool allows users to intuitively adjust the map's rotation by dragging the north arrow around a circle, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:mapcontrol}.


I also improved the animation of moving objects in mapapps, particularly for a layer that displays live bus positions in Münster. Previously, buses would appear to 'teleport' across the map; my update, using the animejs library, enabled smooth motion during position updates.

My final task for this phase was to assess the compatibility of Esri's ArcGIS Indoors Technology with map.apps. The evaluation concluded that compatibility is currently limited.

In the new phase, I mainly developed a 2D digital twin. To achieve this, I altered the 2D-3D switch and created a new bundle. The bundle checks system requirements to indicate if the user's device is 3D capable. I also updated the table of contents to include a hint that each 3D layer is exclusively 3D. 
Additionally, I configured and extended the map.apps intro functionality.
\subsubsection{Project Reflection}
The project was organized through weekly meetings and a Jira board with tickets. As I joined the project at a later stage, I did not participate as much. At the start of the project, I received no proper onboarding and worked on tickets without context or understanding. I was onboarded for the project after the finalization of the first project phase. Following a month of work on the Geosphere Project, I was reassigned to work on some prototype features for the digital twin. However, neither the Jira board nor the weekly meetings were utilized effectively this time.

\subsection{Geosphere}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
Geosphere is the central geoscientific institution for Austria, covering geology, geophysics, climatology, and meteorology.  It was formed by the merger of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), founded in 1851, the national meteorological and earthquake service, and the Geological Survey (GBA), founded in 1849. 
Geosphere, needs an new Climate Atlas. They stated they need this because of EU Regulations. The new atlas should be developed by the con terra, as they were recommended. Currently, the project is in the acquisition stage and i developed a prototype with few example datasets.

\subsubsection{As-is Status}
At present, there is no system in place to handle the dynamic visualization of the data. However, Geosphere is capable of producing the source data independently. 
\subsubsection{Requirements}
As this is part of an acquisition, there were no strict requirements. The prototype I developed should just be able to visualize the provided data in a interactive way. Additional Goals were to create a mockup GUI for this and to be able to generate user specific reports. 
\subsubsection{Technical Aspects}
The project is in its basis a map.apps project. The data were provided in form of spatio-temporal data cubes (netcdf). The data were partially transformed and hosted in an ArcGIS Enterprise Environment. The other part were accessible by a python backend.
\subsubsection{My Participation}
For this project, I primarily developed a prototype that can be presented. The prototype was based on a map.apps project.    I received multiple datasets with \glsxtrfull{rcp} Scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) that were split into two types: time series data and median data. The median datasets only contained the median value for a given period for the entirety of Austria. The dataset includes complete model simulations and associated statics for Austria, presented in rasterized 1000 x 1000m blocks. The variable measured is 'SU30', representing the number of days with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius.
The median data was visualized in map.apps and a user interface was developed to provide more intuitive control over the displayed data. In addition, I developed a Python backend and frontend to enable the visualization of time series data in map.apps. The Python backend was based on FastAPI and accessed the datacubes directly. The frontend creates plots on the fly using Plotly. Finally, I created a reporting function that allows the user to generate a report based on the selected data. The data is then aggregated into a PDF that can be printed.

\subsubsection{Project Reflection}
As this was not a real project but an acquisition, I worked alone without any structure or organization.  I was simply given the data, a brief description of the tech stack I should use, and an example of the goal, which was the Climate Atlas of Canada. Later in the project, I had a few meetings with my team lead to discuss what still needed to be done and what was finished. The project ended unexpectedly for me as I was reassigned to work again at the \glsxtrshort{dz}.
\section{Reflection}

 \subsubsection{Communication Aspects}
In the following i will describe a few Communication Aspsects which were consistent through the whole internship.
 \begin{description}[]
     \item[Supervisor Communication:] I had bi-weekly meetings with my supervisor. These were scheduled meetings that were 30 minutes long.
     \item[Teamwork:] I was part of the team, but because teams do not work together on a project, I did not really get to know each team member. Instead, I had regular contact with individuals who worked on the same project. 
     \item[Professional Network:] As I had already worked for two years prior to my internship at con terra, I did not expand my professional network in any way.
     \item[Conflicts:] There were no conflicts during my internship that involved me.
    %  \item[Communication Skills:]  During my internship, I did not acquire any new communication skills related to working on large-scale projects beyond prototypes. However, I did attend career services seminars where I learned a few new skills.
      \item[Applied Communication Skills:]  As the general workflow and interaction in con terra are very similar to those in the university, I could easily adapt.
\end{description}

\subsection{Master Thesis Implications}
The internship experience did not provide topics that would align with the requirements or themes suitable for a Master's thesis. However, I proactively addressed this by discussing potential thesis topics with my supervisor within the broader scope of the organization's interests and projects.

The discussions focused on Wind Turbine Placement, a topic of increasing importance in sustainable energy and spatial planning. con terra has expressed a clear interest in this topic. The federal states are actively seeking software solutions to 3D model wind turbines and analyze their placements. This aligns with con terra's ambitions for a digital twin.

A digital twin involves creating a virtual replica of a physical entity or system, offering a sophisticated approach to analyzing and optimizing wind turbine placement. This approach can contribute significantly to the efficient and sustainable development of wind energy resources, which is critical for environmental sustainability and energy transition.

Currently, the idea of focusing a Master's thesis on this topic is in its early stages and has not been definitively decided. It is still a concept under consideration, and its potential and feasibility have yet to be fully explored and confirmed. This ongoing discussion reflects the dynamic nature of academic and professional exploration, where ideas evolve and are refined over time, in alignment with both academic objectives and the practical needs of the industry.

\subsection{Learning Goals}
 In the following I will list each Learning Goal and evaluate if it was reached in the course of the internship

 \begin{description}[]
     \item[Enhancement of proficiency in GIS software and infrastructure:]  This learning goal has been fully achieved. I have deepened my expertise in desktop GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro, as well as on the server side with ArcGIS Server infrastructure. Additionally, I have gained experience in developing web GIS applications using the ArcGIS JS SDK and map.apps. I have also worked with various dataset types, including PEI datasets, file geodatabases, and NetCDF. 
     \item[Further development of coding and data analysis capabilities:] This learning objective was fully achieved. I have developed several different applications in several languages. For example, I developed a complete Spring Boot app with a SQL database. I also developed some Python components and several JS applications for map.apps. In the context of data analysis I have a lot of experience with netCDF files and ArcGIS and Python.
     \item[Mastery in data management]: Not archived. Although my internship had parts of data analysis, it was never the main focus. Data management consisted mainly of converting any data into an ArcGIS format and publishing it to an ArcGIS server. I also used flat structures for files that could not be converted to ArcGIS compatible formats.
     \item[Acquisition of knowledge in emerging technology standards:] Partially archived. Even though I did not learn any extremely new technology, I did learn a lot of new technologies and how to use them. For example: Vue(3), SpringBoot, Nginx and Redis.
     \item[Familiarization with project management and participation in large-scale projects:] Not archived. I did not work on any large-scale projects during my internship.
     \item[Development of collaborative skills for team environments:] Archived. I have had some experience of working with real teams. Especially in the GD NRW project.
     \item[Improvement in effective communication strategies:] Not archived, as i did not work enough in teams.  
     \item[Skill development in recognizing correlations between various topics:] Not archived, as I only visited a few projects, I was not able to make any real connections.
     \item[Improvement in strategizing for problem-solving:] Archived. As I encountered many different problems, I learned new strategies to solve them.
 \end{description}

 I achieved four out of nine goals, which I still consider a success. The goals that were not met were too abstract unrealistic, or not fitting for con terra. Therefore, one of the most important things I learned from the internship is what to expect and what not to expect when working in the industry.

 \subsection{Summary and conclusions}

 My internship at con terra was, in my opinion, a successful first experience in the industry. I gained knowledge in the applied usage of new technologies and deepened my understanding of technologies I was already familiar with. Additionally, I acquired new social skills, such as working in small teams, and further developed my soft skills. During my internship, I had the opportunity to develop my soft skills while working in the office and interacting with colleagues. 
 For my future studies, I do not believe that my internship will provide significant benefits. However, as my studies are coming to an end, it is likely that I will remain at con terra.

% \section{Work Experience}
% \subsection{Project Context}
% \subsubsection{Geologischer Dienst NRW - Metdata Asset Managment System}
% The  \glsxtrshort {gd} NRW has a large achieve of different assets, which are currently managed by a software named cumulus. As the used software is outdated, it does not meet the the current requirements.
% Primarily they  are required to make all data, where it is legally possible, open data \cite{GesetzZurForderung2017}.
% Additionally, the GeolDG also requires the \glsxtrshort{gd} to make their accessible by the public \cite{GesetzZurStaatlichen2020}.

% Therefore, the main goal of this project was to conceptualize a new system and to implement parallel a prototype of it.
% The \glsxtrshort{gd} digital archive contains over 450,000 assets. Assets in this context are for example images, PDFs, TIFs or MP4s. However, any digital file can be an asset. The total data volume is over 2 terabytes.
% These assets are currently located on a shared drive and can be managed via the file system. They also use a piece of software called Cumulus. This software primarily manages the metadata associated with the assets. Currently, the \glsxtrshort{gd} does not use any known metadata schema, but instead uses a list of custom attributes, such as Rating, Special Instructions and Label.
% They also use \glsxtrshort{exif} and \glsxtrshort{iptc} metadata information for images, which is not managed by Cumulus. Instead, this is done with an additional software component.

% The new system should eliminate the inadequacies of the old system. Therefore a list of Requirements were collected. In the following there is a subset example of the main functional requirements:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Keeping the Internal metadata attributes (and adding new ones)
%     \item Connection to the GEOportal.NRW
%     \item CRUD Operations for Datasets and associated metadata
%           \begin{itemize}
%               \item With an Integrated Permission System for Internal (\glsxtrshort{gd} Employees) and Externals
%               \item (Multi-)Edit Interface for Metadata
%           \end{itemize}
%     \item Sharing data
%     \item Keep \glsxtrshort{exif} and \glsxtrshort{iptc} in sync
%     \item Syncing/Translating Internal Metadata to ISO 19115/ISO 19119
%     \item Different Search Operations
% \end{itemize}

% In addition, there are a number of quality requirements that focus primarily on data integrity and the tech stack used for development. For example, the software developed should be able to live in the cloud or on a dedicated machine.

% A final requirement is that the system needs to be split. It should mainly run on the servers of IT.NRW. But only non-sensitive data should be hosted there. Sensitive data should be hosted and only accessible by the \glsxtrshort{gd} and its staff.
% \subsubsection{\glsxtrfull{dz}}
% In the wake of the catastrophic flooding in Ahrtal, significant deficiencies in the hazard prevention and emergency response systems (of NRW) were exposed. Critical challenges were observed in the coordination and communication among dispatched units, such as the  \glsxtrfull{thw} and the fire department. Effective communication and organization are crucial for swift and efficient emergency responses.

% Following the enactment of the "Krisenbewältigungsgesetz" in NRW in December 2022, the state government officially recognized this deficiency as an emergency situation on February 23. In response, a budget of €500,000 was allocated to address this issue.

% con terra, in collaboration with IT.NRW, submitted a proposal to develop a solution to these challenges. Their proposed solution is the creation of a digital twin, designed to aggregate and optimally visualize all relevant data for various potential scenarios. This solution aims to integrate multiple datasets from diverse sources, including the GDI-NW, LVN, and the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG).
% There are currently no central systems in place to handle this kind of task. Mostly there are department specific solutions or even general purpose Systems like QGIS or ArcGIS.
% This consultancy project aims to develop a prototype which has flexible yet pivotal requirements. Some requirements were also refined and established in collaboration with fire departments during the project's course. Below is a summary of the key requirements:

% \begin{description}[]
%     \item[Three-Dimensional Capability]: Reflecting the three-dimensional nature of real-world challenges, the solution must be capable of visualizing 3D data and performing basic general-purpose operations, such as measurements, in a 3D environment.
%     \item[Scenario-Optimized Geodata]: The digital twin should tailor its data visualization and accessibility for different emergency scenarios, acknowledging that not all datasets are suitable for every scenario. Primary scenario groups include Fire, Earth, Water, and Air.
%     \item[Compliance with \glsxtrshort{bhkg}]: The prototype should be developed with the objective of planning, monitoring, and follow-up in accordance with \glsxtrshort{bhkg} standards.
%     \item[Target Group - Authorities and Security Organizations]: The prototype should be user-friendly for its target audience, which includes authorities and organizations involved in security tasks, without assuming extensive geospatial knowledge.
%     \item[Cloud-Based Solution]: The entire application should be cloud-based, ensuring accessibility and scalability.
%     \item[Fine-Grained Access Control]: Given the potential inclusion of sensitive data (e.g., \glsxtrshort{kritis} data), the application must feature a robust access control system, allowing users to view only data relevant to their roles and responsibilities.
%     \item[Analysis Tools]: The application should offer comprehensive analysis tools. For the prototype, these will include the ability to identify and assess the accessibility of protected assets, dynamically determine water levels in 3D, and simulate the spread of smoke clouds in 3D.
%     \item[Integration of 3D Meshes]: The prototype should incorporate a detailed 3D mesh, which is currently being developed for the entire state of NRW.
%     \item[EPSG: 25832 Standard]: As a governmental project, the application must utilize the EPSG: 25832 standard for all geospatial data.
% \end{description}

% However, it is important to note that not all these requirements will be fully met in the initial phase of this project.
% \subsubsection{Geosphere}
% Geosphere is the central geoscientific institution for Austria, covering geology, geophysics, climatology, and meteorology.  It was formed by the merger of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), founded in 1851, the national meteorological and earthquake service, and the Geological Survey (GBA), founded in 1849. 
% Geosphere, needs an new Climate Atlas. They stated they need this because of EU Regulations. The new atlas should be developed by the con terra, as they were recommended. Currently the project is in the acquisition stage and i developed a prototype with few example datasets.
% %Todo: Ergänzen warum wir das machen..
% \subsection{Assigned Work}
% \subsubsection{Geologischer Dienst NRW - Metadata Asset Management System}
% My involvement in this project focused on the development of new software components for a prototype. Furthermore, I made modifications to the smart.finder SDI.


% The prototype I created was a basic project that used FastAPI and Python. It included an extra PostgreSQL database. The main goal was to design a database schema that met our needs. We chose a flat structure without any N-M relationships.
% Also, I designed the frontend. Our technological stack for the frontend consisted of Vue and Vuetify, with the inclusion of a Vite development server. The primary Vue components that I developed include Single Editing for modifying a single Metadata set and Multi-Edit for modifying multiple Metadatasets. To create Single Editing, I used a mockup as a template to base my development on. I designed, conceptualised and implemented Multi-Editing myself.

% Later on in the project, I developed an additional front-end for a shopping cart, which serves as an intermediary website between the smart.finder SDI and the new components. Moreover, I developed a front-end for the administrator to configure various attributes for editing.

% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \caption{Vue Java Controller}
%     \label{fig:vue}
%     \begin{lstlisting}[language=java, frame=single]
%         @Controller
%         public class VueController {
%             @RequestMapping(value = "/*/{path:[^\\.]*}")
%             public String redirect(){
%                 return "forward:/";
%             }
%         }

%         \end{lstlisting}
%     \centering
% \end{figure}


% After that, a decision was made to drop Python and FastAPI in favour of Spring Boot and Java. This began by implementing the required Spring Data classes and interfaces. Afterwards I began implementing the fundamental endpoints for \glsxtrshort{crud} operations to restore functionality to the frontend. Additionally, the capacities to host the built front-end on the Spring Boot server were incorporated. I developed a special Spring Boot controller to keep the Vue router component of the frontend working, as it controls the routing. Incase a website should be laoded it redirects to the Vue Router and enables it to route it. The code for this can be found in \ref{fig:vue}. It should be noted that any requests that match the applied regex pattern will be directed to the Vue Router, even those that have no match in the Router.

% An Azure build pipeline was developed to enable automated deployment on our test system. This required restructuring the project into two distinct components: the frontend and the backend. Each component is now a complete Maven project, with its own pom.xml file. Furthermore, the entire project is encapsulated in a separate Maven project, which also has its own pom.xml file. The Maven arrangement enables the project to be built with the fully integrated frontend and backend, specifically tailored for the pipeline. To deploy to our test machine, we utilized the tomcat-maven-plugin.

% Later, I developed an additional API component. It is a Spring Boot application that accesses the smart.finder SDI and alters its Solr database. During development, I extended the smart.finder SDI Solr core to handle additional attributes beyond ISO. Moreover, I enhanced the frontend of the smart.finder SDI to display those attributes.
% Also i created an automated ISO XML generation based on our new attributes.

% Finally, I have developed several complex features, including thumbnail generation for images and PDFs, on-the-fly zipped group downloads, \glsxtrshort{iptc}/\glsxtrshort{exif} read and write capabilities, and the deployment of a Redis Instance for fast and secure storage. This addition will facilitate the transition from the smartfinder to the new components. Also i deployed an Nginx instance as a reverse proxy for basic authentication, with TLS support.


% \subsubsection{\glsxtrfull{dz}}
% I joined the project during its final stages and focused on a limited but significant set of tasks. My primary responsibility involved integrating data provided by the fire department. I worked with a PEI Dataset, which consisted of radio messages containing location data, such as Short PDU, Long PDU, or STATUS. An example of this data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pei}. The first line of each message includes metadata, like the transmitting and receiving parties, and the message type. The HEX-Code following this metadata can be converted to binary and decoded according to the ETSI TS 100 392-18-1 standard. I developed a Python script to automate this process, outputting the data as an ESRI feature layer.

% \begin{figure}[H]

%         0A004C9CD24739C9384820
%     \end{lstlisting}
%     \centering
% \end{figure}

% Additionally, I developed a new map control tool, enhancing user interaction with map features such as position, rotation, tilt, and zoom. This tool allows users to intuitively adjust the map's rotation by dragging the north arrow around a circle, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:mapcontrol}.

% \begin{figure}[H]
%     \caption{Map Control Tool Screenshot}
%     \label{fig:mapcontrol}
%     \includegraphics[width=16cm]{dzgefahr_mapcontrol.png}
%     \centering
% \end{figure}

% I also improved the animation of moving objects in map.apps, particularly for a layer that displays live bus positions in Münster. Previously, buses would appear to 'teleport' across the map; my update, using the animejs library, enabled smooth motion during position updates.

% My final task was to assess the compatibility of Esri's ArcGIS Indoors Technology with mapapps. The evaluation concluded that compatibility is currently limited.
% \subsubsection{Geosphere}
% For this project, I primarily developed a prototype that can be presented. The prototype was based on a map.apps project.    I received multiple datasets with \glsxtrfull{rcp} Scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) that were split into two types: timeseries data and median data. The median datasets only contained the median value for a given period for the entirety of Austria. The dataset includes complete model simulations and associated statics for Austria, presented in rasterized 1000 x 1000m blocks. The variable measured is 'SU30', representing the number of days with temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius.
% The median data was visualized in map.apps and a user interface was developed to provide more intuitive control over the displayed data. In addition, I developed a Python backend and frontend to enable the visualization of time series data in map.apps. The Python backend was based on FastAPI and accessed the datacubes directly. The frontend creates plots on the fly using Plotly. Finally, I created a reporting function that allows the user to generate a report based on the selected data. The data is then aggregated into a PDF that can be printed.



% \subsubsection{Study Relevant Competencies}
% During my internship, I applied concepts and skills from my academic curriculum in Geoinformatics and Spatial Data Science. The internship required me to use my software development competencies, which I developed through various modules in my study program. The internship required the development of software components using programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Python. Basic database management competencies, which were also a part of my academic training, proved to be highly valuable in addition to these programming skills.

% However, it is important to note that my university curriculum did not cover certain aspects that were essential to my internship. Specifically, the use of Frontend Frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue, as well as other practical applications of frameworks and libraries in these programming languages were not addressed. As a result, I had to learn on my own to become proficient in these areas.

% Moreover, I did not receive formal education on the use of Object-Relational Mapping (ORMs) for database access, a critical component in modern software development, which was extensively utilized during my internship. Furthermore, the planning and development of complex and complete infrastructures, which are pivotal in large-scale software projects, were not covered in my academic syllabus.

% Furthermore, my formal education did not cover advanced concepts such as Reverse Proxies and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, which are crucial for ensuring secure and efficient web communication. Additionally, I did not receive any instruction on the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the context of 3D environments.

% % In summary, my academic background in Geoinformatics and Spatial Data Science provided a strong foundation in software development and basic database management. However, my internship experience highlighted the need for a more expansive curriculum that includes practical applications of modern software frameworks, advanced infrastructure planning, and the integration of GIS in 3D modelling. This will better prepare students for the evolving demands of the industry.

% \subsubsection{The state of planning}
% Afterwards, I was supposed to be involved in the Open Pioneer track, where I would integrate 3D functionalities using DeckGL to enhance its capabilities. However, it was later reassessed and deemed infeasible. 
% As a result, my internship took a different direction, and I was reassigned to work on the DZGefahr project for a few months. Following this, I developed the Geosphere prototype.

% \section{Results Obtained}
% The evaluation of my internship work was carried out using a methodology that differed from traditional report-based evaluations; the evaluation process was more incremental and continuous, rather than resulting in a formal report.

% Feedback was primarily given through direct interactions with other developers, project leads, and user experience (UX) designers. The mechanism for feedback was informal and integrated into the daily workflow. It did not involve structured meetings solely for performance evaluation. Instead, feedback was integrated into the collaborative process, offering immediate and practical insights into the quality and relevance of contributions.

% When a feature was considered acceptable, it was marked as complete. The primary tool for tracking progress and organizing tasks was the use of Jira boards.

% In addition to this ongoing feedback mechanism, I had bi-weekly discussions with my supervisor. These meetings served as a platform to evaluate not only the current state of specific projects I was working on but also the overall progression of my internship experience.

% \section{Project contributions}
% As my work was primarily focused on developing prototypes, I could not see any contributions to a larger project. Instead, most of the things I did will hopefully become part of a larger project at a later stage, as my prototypes were primarily used for acquisition purposes.

% \section{Communication competences}
% In the following i will describe various Communication competencies in a short way.
% \begin{description}[]
%     \item[Supervisor Communication:] As previously stated, I had bi-weekly meetings with my supervisor. These were scheduled meetings.
%     \item[Teamwork:] I was part of the team, but because teams do not work together on a project, I did not really get to know each team member. Instead, I had regular contact with individuals who worked on the same project. However, as my tasks were mostly isolated, I worked independently without a team.
%     \item[Professional Network:] As I had already worked for two years prior to my internship at con terra, I did not expand my professional network in any way.
%     \item[Conflicts:] There were no conflicts during my internship that involved me.
%     \item[Communication Skills:]  During my internship, I did not acquire any new communication skills related to working on large-scale projects beyond prototypes. However, I did attend career services seminars where I learned a few new skills.
%     \item[Applied Communication Skills:]  As the general workflow and interaction in con terra are very similar to those in the university, I could easily adapt.
% \end{description}

% \section{Master Thesis Implications}
% The internship experience did not provide topics that would align with the requirements or themes suitable for a Master's thesis. However, I proactively addressed this by discussing potential thesis topics with my supervisor within the broader scope of the organization's interests and projects.

% The discussions centred on Wind Turbine Placement, a subject of growing interest and relevance in sustainable energy and spatial planning. con terra has expressed a clear interest in this topic. The federal states are actively seeking software solutions to simplify and optimise the process of placing wind turbines. This aligns with con terra's ambitions for a digital twin.

% A digital twin involves creating a virtual replica of a physical entity or system, offering a sophisticated approach to analyzing and optimizing wind turbine placement. This approach can contribute significantly to the efficient and sustainable development of wind energy resources, which is critical for environmental sustainability and energy transition.

% Currently, the idea of focusing a Master's thesis on this topic is in its early stages and has not been definitively decided. It is still a concept under consideration, and its potential and feasibility have yet to be fully explored and confirmed. This ongoing discussion reflects the dynamic nature of academic and professional exploration, where ideas evolve and are refined over time, in alignment with both academic objectives and the practical needs of the industry.

% \section{Learning Goals}
% In the following I will list each Learning Goal and evaluate if it was reached in the course of the internship

% \begin{description}[]
%     \item[Enhancement of proficiency in GIS software and infrastructure:]  This learning goal has been fully achieved. I have deepened my expertise in desktop GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro, as well as on the server side with ArcGIS Server infrastructure. Additionally, I have gained experience in developing web GIS applications using the ArcGIS JS SDK and map.apps. I have also worked with various dataset types, including PEI datasets, file geodatabases, and NetCDF. 
%     \item[Further development of coding and data analysis capabilities:] This learning objective was fully achieved. I have developed several different applications in several languages. For example, I developed a complete Spring Boot app with a SQL database. I also developed some Python components and several JS applications for map.apps. In the context of data analysis I have a lot of experience with netCDF files and ArcGIS and Python.
%     \item[Mastery in data management]: Not archived. Although my internship had parts of data analysis, it was never the main focus. Data management consisted mainly of converting any data into an ArcGIS format and publishing it to an ArcGIS server. I also used flat structures for files that could not be converted to ArcGIS compatible formats.
%     \item[Acquisition of knowledge in emerging technology standards:] Partially archived. Even though I did not learn any extremely new technology, I did learn a lot of new technologies and how to use them. For example: Vue(3), SpringBoot, Nginx and Redis.
%     \item[Familiarization with project management and participation in large-scale projects:] Not archived. I did not work on any large-scale projects during my internship.
%     \item[Development of collaborative skills for team environments:] Archived. I have had some experience of working with real teams. Especially in the GD NRW project.
%     \item[Improvement in effective communication strategies:] Not archived, as i did not work enough in teams.  
%     \item[Skill development in recognizing correlations between various topics:] As I only visited a few projects, I was not able to make any real connections.
%     \item[Improvement in strategizing for problem-solving:] Archived. As I encountered many different problems, I learned new strategies to solve them.
% \end{description}

% I achieved four out of nine goals, which I still consider a success. The goals that were not met were too abstract unrealistic, or not fitting for con terra. Therefore, one of the most important things I learned from the internship is what to expect and what not to expect when working in the industry.

% \section{Summary and conclusions}

% My internship at con terra was, in my opinion, a successful first experience in the industry. I gained knowledge in the applied usage of new technologies and deepened my understanding of technologies I was already familiar with. Additionally, I acquired new social skills, such as working in small teams, and further developed my soft skills. During my internship, I had the opportunity to develop my soft skills while working in the office and interacting with colleagues. 
% For my future studies, I do not believe that my internship will provide significant benefits. However, as my studies are coming to an end, it is likely that I will remain at con terra.
